If you are just getting started with scapesClassification and you would like to have a general overview of the package capabilities you can consult the [github page](https://ghtaranto.github.io/scapesClassification/) and the working example articles. For a deeper understanding of how the package works you can consult the implementation articles and the examples throughout the package documentation.

## Working example

The working example provides a general overview about the package capabilities. It shows how to use **scapesClassification** to identify raster objects and marine seafloor structures (geomorphic management units - GMUs) and identify raster objects. It is separated in four articles: 

1. [Format input data](scapesClassification_01_1_FormatInputs.html); 

2. [Island shelf unit](scapesClassification_02_2_ISU.html);

3. [Peak cells](scapesClassification_02_3_PKS.html); 

4. [Relief unit and raster objects](scapesClassification_02_4_OBJ.html);

---

## Implementation

The implementation articles provide more insights about the functioning of the package. In particular they explain what types of classification rules can be considered, how they are parsed and how they are evaluated. In addition, classification and raster object functions are introduced. 

1. [Format inputs](scapesClassification_01_1_FormatInputs.html)

2. [Rule evaluation and types](scapesClassification_01_2_RulesEvalTypes.html)

3. [Classification functions](scapesClassification_01_3_ClassFunctions.html)

4. [Object functions](scapesClassification_01_4_ObjFunctions.html)

## Functions

Examples are included throughout the package [documentation](https://ghtaranto.github.io/scapesClassification/reference/index.html). Consult the function documentation `?conditions` for a general overview on how classifications are performed. 




In `scapesClassification` there are four groups of [functions](https://ghtaranto.github.io/scapesClassification/reference/index.html): 

* ***Format input functions*** are used to format the spatial layers provided by users and make them available to other package functions;

* ***Helper functions*** are used to help users handle classification vectors and condition strings;

* ***Classification functions*** are used to identify anchor locations and classify raster cells based on targeted evaluations of user-defined classification rules;

* ***Raster object functions*** are used to identify and manipulate raster objects.
