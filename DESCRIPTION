Description: Classification of seascapes or landscapes using environmental 
  and geographic data stored as Raster* objects. The classification is 
  implemented using a stepwise procedure. At each step a portion of the 
  'scape' is classified based on user defined conditions, local spatial 
  statistics and/or spatial contiguity between classes. The portion of 
  'scape' classified can be considered in the next classification step. 
  User defined conditions can be absolute, relative to the focal cell or 
  relative to the focal neighbourhood.
