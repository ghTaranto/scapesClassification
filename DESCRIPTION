Description: The R-package scapesClassification is designed to translate
  users' mental models of seascapes, landscapes and, more generally, of
  geo-spaces into computer representations (classifications). Spaces and
  geographic objects are classified with user-defined rules taking into account
  spatial data as well as spatial relationships among different classes and
  objects.
