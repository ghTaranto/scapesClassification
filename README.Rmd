[_scapesClassification_](https://github.com/ghTaranto/scapesClassification "GitHub repository") is an R-package for the classification of seascapes, landscapes and other geo-spaces based on user-defined conditions. It allows users to translate task-oriented views of spaces and of geographic objects into computer representations.

# How does _scapesClassification_ work?
Geo-spaces are classified using sets of user-defined conditions. These sets of conditions, presented in the form of [conditional statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming) "Wikipedia definition"), can be applied simultaneously or sequentially. The second alternative is generally preferred. In fact, the rationale that guided the design of _scapesClassification_ is better implemented considering multi-step classification processes:

1. Geographic objects and segments of space can be identified by a unique class (or set of classes); 

2. Generally, it is easier to identify attributes that are distinctive of a portion of a class rather then identify its full range of attributes at once;

3. Thus, distinctive attributes can be used to map an initial set of locations to a class. These locations are hereafter referred to as ___anchor locations___;

4. Then, it becomes possible to map a location to a class not only considering its intrinsic attributes, but also its spatial relationships with anchor locations;

5. In particular, _class contiguity_ and _class continuity_ can be considered;

6. ___Class contiguity.___ Qualitative and/or quantitative conditions define the membership of a location to a class only if they occur in positions considered adjacent to a specific class;

7. ___Class continuity.___ When two adjacent locations are assigned to the same class using contiguity conditions, these conditions can be re-applied at positions neighboring the newly classified locations;

8. Distinct classes can be identified repeating the above process and considering the relationships expected to exist among classified and unclassified locations.
